# Intermediate Qutrit-based Improved Quantum Arithmetic Operations with Application on Financial Derivative Pricing

## Abstract

In some quantum algorithms, arithmetic operations are of utmost importance for resource estimation. In binary quantum systems, some efficient implementation of arithmetic operations like, addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, square root, exponential and arcsine etc. have been realized, where resources are reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates with ancilla. Recently it has been demonstrated that intermediate qutrits can be used in place of ancilla, allowing us to operate efficiently in the ancilla-free frontier zone. In this article, we have incorporated intermediate qutrit approach to realize efficient implementation of all the quantum arithmetic operations mentioned above with respect to gate count and circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla. Our resource estimates with intermediate qutrits could guide future research aimed at lowering costs considering arithmetic operations for computational problems. As an application of computational problems, related to finance, are poised to reap the benefit of quantum computers, in which quantum arithmetic circuits are going to play an important role. In particular, quantum arithmetic circuits of arcsine and square root are necessary for path loading using the re-parameterization method, as well as the payoff calculation for derivative pricing. Hence, the improvements are studied in the context of the core arithmetic circuits as well as the complete application of derivative pricing. Since our intermediate qutrit approach requires to access higher energy levels, making the design prone to errors, nevertheless, we show that the percentage decrease in the probability of error is significant owing to the fact that we achieve circuit robustness compared to qubit-only works.
